# Evo-toolkits
This repo stores some helpful scripts and optimized tools in genomic & evolutionary analysis.

## Synteny
`synteny.R` includes a customized script to draw genomic synteny plot based on synteny results from `jcvi mcscan` , which has main functions of drawing basic graph, treating with overlapping, color annotation, etc. `all_species_final_blocks.tsv` and `all_species.bed` are example data as input of the script. 

Thanks Yilan Luo in our lab for motivating me create this code.
